# Ascii-art-project
This project converts a real image into ASCII art using only core Python and logical image-processing techniques. Instead of using external libraries, the program directly reads a 24-bit BMP file, converts it to grayscale , resizes it mathematically, and maps pixel brightness to ASCII characters.
